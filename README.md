## Hello there!
My name is Lam (which translates to ‚Äúforest‚Äù üå≥), but I go by Joe as in Joseph the Saint. I'm from Vietnam, studied Hospitality for 3 years in Singapore, worked various hotel jobs for a span of 4+ years in my hometown city of Nha Trang, Vietnam, and now I end up here studying Computer Programming in Toronto, Canada. What a journey!

I got engrossed into the world of tech since Grade 5 when my dad bought me my first PC. I have been playing around with assembling hardware and installing software ever since. I help out my family members and relatives with everything tech. I'm also a huge nerd when it comes to Apple devices. I would stay up the entire night to watch any Apple Keynote live from my country. I would rummage the Internet for any tutorials and reviews on Apple hardware and software. At one point in my Grade 8, I used to spend weeks translating an iPod user manual into Vietnamese just for the fun of it.

I chose studying Computer Programming as an entry to fulfill my passion in tech, since I've been longing to become a mobile app developer for years.
